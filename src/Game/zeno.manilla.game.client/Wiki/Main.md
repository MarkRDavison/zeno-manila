## Conflict loop

### NOT ABOUT LONG TERM CONVENTIONAL WARFARE

> *Maybe blockades or something?  Not actually fighting but provoking unrest*
*Destabilizing actions, not conventional warfare*

- Questions about how much to use
	- i.e. ICBM defense, how much per missile etc
	- Maybe have policies based on launch location, amount etc
	- Basically thought process, Russia has attacked, China looks like they might, how much do you want to spend to defend against Russia

- Give orders to assets
	- Send navy somewhere etc
	- But won't run for a long time and cannot micro manage
	- Defense plans etc, too much is happening too quickly to do anything but trust training

- Questions about retaliation
	- Activate plan red etc

- If you use WMD's most other nations will group up on you, so don't do it

## Long term goals

- Control the high ground, i.e. space
- World conquest
- Escape the solar system?
- Aliens?
- Manage climate change?
	- Influence others or take them over to force compliance
